## Examples

There are two kind of uses, either Synchronous or Asynchronous:

Synchronous Subscriber

```js
const MQTT = require('../sync/mqtt.js');

const options = {
  hostname: 'localhost',
  port: 1883,
  username: 'MyUserName',
  password: 'MySecretPassword',
  credential: 'MyCredential',
};

const useOnConnection = (connectData) => {
  console.log('Connected = ', connectData);
}

const useOnDisconnection = () => {
  console.log('Disconnecting!!!');
}

const useOnMessage = (topic, payload) => {
  console.log('Topic = %O , Payload = %O', topic, payload.toString());
}

const useOnError = (error) => {
  console.log('This is an error = ', error);
}

options.topic = 'topic/subtopic/data';
const sub = new MQTT(options);

// Assign function handlers
sub.handleConnect = useOnConnection;
sub.handleMessage = useOnMessage;
sub.handleError = useOnError;
sub.handleDisconnect = useOnDisconnection;

// Connect
const client = sub.connect();
// Subscribe to topic
sub.subscribe('topic/subtopic/data');
```

Synchronous Publisher

```js
const MQTT = require('../sync/mqtt.js');

const options = {
  hostname: 'localhost',
  port: 1883,
  username: 'MyUserName',
  password: 'MySecretPassword',
  credential: 'MyCredential',
};

const useOnConnection = (connectData) => {
  console.log('Connected = ', connectData);
}

const useOnDisconnection = () => {
  console.log('Disconnecting!!!');
}

const useOnError = (error) => {
  console.log('This is an error = ', error);
}

const pub = new MQTT(options);

// Assign function handlers
pub.handleConnect = useOnConnection;
pub.handleError = useOnError;
pub.handleDisconnect = useOnDisconnection;

// Connect
const client = pub.connect();
// Publish message to topic
pub.publish('topic/subtopic/data', 'Some important message');
pub.disconnect();

```

Asynchronous Subscriber

```js
const MQTTAsync = require('../async/mqtt.js');

const options = {
  hostname: 'localhost',
  port: 1883,
  username: 'MyUserName',

### new MQTTClass(options)

The `MQTT Client` class wraps a client connection to an
MQTT broker over an arbitrary transport method (TCP, TLS,
WebSocket, ecc).

`MQTT Client` automatically handles the following:

* Regular server pings
* QoS flow
* Automatic reconnections
* Start publishing before being connected

The arguments are:

* `options` is the client connection options. Defaults:
  * `wsOptions`: is the WebSocket connection options. Default is `{}`.
     It's specific for WebSockets. For possible options have a look at: https://github.com/websockets/ws/blob/master/doc/ws.md.
  * `keepalive`: `60` seconds, set to `0` to disable
  * `reschedulePings`: reschedule ping messages after sending packets (default `true`)
  * `clientId`: `'mqttjs_' + Math.random().toString(16).substr(2, 8)`
  * `protocolId`: `'MQTT'`
  * `protocolVersion`: `4`
  * `clean`: `true`, set to false to receive QoS 1 and 2 messages while offline
  * `reconnectPeriod`: `1000` milliseconds, interval between two reconnections. Disable auto reconnect by setting to `0`.
  * `connectTimeout`: `30 * 1000` milliseconds, time to wait before a CONNACK is received
  * `username`: the username required by your broker, if any
  * `password`: the password required by your broker, if any
  * `incomingStore`: a [Store](#store) for the incoming packets
  * `outgoingStore`: a [Store](#store) for the outgoing packets
  * `queueQoSZero`: if connection is broken, queue outgoing QoS zero messages (default `true`)
  * `customHandleAcks`: MQTT 5 feature of custom handling puback and pubrec packets. Its callback:
      ```js
        customHandleAcks: function(topic, message, packet, done) {/*some logic wit colling done(error, reasonCode)*/}
      ```
  * `autoUseTopicAlias`: enabling automatic Topic Alias using functionality
  * `autoAssignTopicAlias`: enabling automatic Topic Alias assign functionality
  * `properties`: properties MQTT 5.0.
  `object` that supports the following properties:
    * `sessionExpiryInterval`: representing the Session Expiry Interval in seconds `number`,
    * `receiveMaximum`: representing the Receive Maximum value `number`,
    * `maximumPacketSize`: representing the Maximum Packet Size the Client is willing to accept `number`,
    * `topicAliasMaximum`: representing the Topic Alias Maximum value indicates the highest value that the Client will accept as a Topic Alias sent by the Server `number`,
    * `requestResponseInformation`: The Client uses this value to request the Server to return Response Information in the CONNACK `boolean`,
    * `requestProblemInformation`: The Client uses this value to indicate whether the Reason String or User Properties are sent in the case of failures `boolean`,
    * `userProperties`: The User Property is allowed to appear multiple times to represent multiple name, value pairs `object`,
    * `authenticationMethod`: the name of the authentication method used for extended authentication `string`,
    * `authenticationData`: Binary Data containing authentication data `binary`
  * `authPacket`: settings for auth packet `object`
  * `will`: a message that will sent by the broker automatically when
     the client disconnect badly. The format is:
    * `topic`: the topic to publish (Usually included either in the subscribe or publish function call)
    * `payload`: the message to publish. (Usually included in the publish function call)
    * `qos`: the QoS
    * `retain`: the retain flag
    * `properties`: properties of will by MQTT 5.0:
      * `willDelayInterval`: representing the Will Delay Interval in seconds `number`,
      * `payloadFormatIndicator`: Will Message is UTF-8 Encoded Character Data or not `boolean`,
      * `messageExpiryInterval`: value is the lifetime of the Will Message in seconds and is sent as the Publication Expiry Interval when the Server publishes the Will Message `number`,
      * `contentType`: describing the content of the Will Message `string`,
      * `responseTopic`: String which is used as the Topic Name for a response message `string`,
      * `correlationData`: The Correlation Data is used by the sender of the Request Message to identify which request the Response Message is for when it is received `binary`,
      * `userProperties`: The User Property is allowed to appear multiple times to represent multiple name, value pairs `object`
  * `transformWsUrl` : optional `(url, options, client) => url` function
        For ws/wss protocols only. Can be used to implement signing
        urls which upon reconnect can have become expired.
  * `resubscribe` : if connection is broken and reconnects,
     subscribed topics are automatically subscribed again (default `true`)
  * `messageIdProvider`: custom messageId provider. when `new UniqueMessageIdProvider()` is set, then non conflict messageId is provided.

In case mqtts (mqtt over tls) is required, the `options` object is
passed through to
[`tls.connect()`](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback).
If you are using a **self-signed certificate**, pass the `rejectUnauthorized: false` option.
Beware that you are exposing yourself to man in the middle attacks, so it is a configuration
that is not recommended for production environments.

#### Event `'connect'`

`function (connack) {}`

Emitted on successful (re)connection (i.e. connack rc=0).
* `connack` received connack packet. When `clean` connection option is `false` and server has a previous session
for `clientId` connection option, then `connack.sessionPresent` flag is `true`. When that is the case,
you may rely on stored session and prefer not to send subscribe commands for the client.

#### Event `'reconnect'`

`function () {}`

Emitted when a reconnect starts.

#### Event `'close'`

`function () {}`

Emitted after a disconnection.

#### Event `'disconnect'`

`function (packet) {}`

Emitted after receiving disconnect packet from broker. MQTT 5.0 feature.

#### Event `'offline'`

`function () {}`

Emitted when the client goes offline.

#### Event `'error'`

`function (error) {}`

Emitted when the client cannot connect (i.e. connack rc != 0) or when a
parsing error occurs.

The following TLS errors will be emitted as an `error` event:

* `ECONNREFUSED`
* `ECONNRESET`
* `EADDRINUSE`
* `ENOTFOUND`

#### Event `'end'`

`function () {}`

Emitted when <a href="#end"><code>mqtt.Client#<b>end()</b></code></a> is called.

#### Event `'message'`

`function (topic, message, packet) {}`

Emitted when the client receives a publish packet
* `topic` topic of the received packet
* `message` payload of the received packet
* `packet` received packet, as defined in

#### Event `'packetsend'`

`function (packet) {}`

Emitted when the client sends any packet. This includes .published() packets
as well as packets used by MQTT for managing subscriptions and connections
* `packet` received packet, as defined in
  [mqtt-packet](https://github.com/mcollina/mqtt-packet)

#### Event `'packetreceive'`

`function (packet) {}`

Emitted when the client receives any packet. This includes packets from
subscribed topics as well as packets used by MQTT for managing subscriptions
and connections
* `packet` received packet, as defined in
  [mqtt-packet](https://github.com/mcollina/mqtt-packet)
